## 🚀 Features

You are just one command away to start your next project

- **Create Github Repo**

- **Create Organisation Repo**

- **Open Project in [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/ "VSCode")**

## Manifest

```
- bike.ipynb --> A python file that run's Helmet-Detection code
- bike.xml   --> A xml file which has the entries of all the co-ordinates of each 
                 image(in the image folder) and has been trained on detecting two classes 
                      1. Helmet
                      2. No Helmet
- README.md ---> This markdown file you are reading.
- Image -------> Images folder has all the images of people wearing and not wearing Helmet
- movie2.mp4 --> These is the movie file on which we are going to run our Helmet-Detection
                 model
                 (Anybody can change these movie file and put there's file for testing😀)
```


## 🦋 Prerequisite

- [Python](https://www.python.org/ "Python") Installed

- Python Basics Understanding

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/ "Git OFficial") Installed

- Git Basic Understanding

- [GH](https://cli.github.com/ "Github CLI") Installed

## 🛠️ Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository

```Bash
git clone https://github.com/king-technologies/Project-Initiator.git
```

2. Change the working directory

```Bash
cd Project-Initiator
```

3. Add Environment Variable path of this directory

4. Run the app using terminal

**🎇 You are Ready to Go!**

## ❗ Available Commands

In the project directory, you can run:

```Bash
create
```

Either run this command in the project folder or set the path of `create.bat` in the environmental variable for executing create command anywhere (Run, cmd, or PowerShell).

```Bash
create <project_name>
```

For creating Local Repo use this command and it will create a local repository in the path provided.

```Bash
create <project_name> -g
```

For creating a Global Repo use this command and it will create a global repository on your GitHub profile using `gh` and make & push the initial commit.

```Bash
create <project_name> -o
```

For creating an Organization Repo use this command and it will create an Organization repository on your GitHub profile using `gh` and make & push the initial commit

> If you pass any other option like `-pr` then the repo will be private otherwise it will be public

## 👷 Built with

- [Python](https://www.python.org/ "Python"): as Main Coding Language for executing commands

- [Batch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batch_file "Batch") : For python file executor

- [Github](https://github.com/ "Github") : For Repo Storage and source code management

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/ "Git") : For Version Control System

- [Github CLI](https://cli.github.com/ "Github CLI"): For Direct Interacting with Github

## 📂 Directory Structure

> [`create.bat`](https://github.com/king-technologies/Project-Initiator/blob/main/create.bat "Create Command"): Command file that will execute the python file

> [`remote.py`](https://github.com/king-technologies/Project-Initiator/blob/main/remote.py "Main File"): Python file, the main file that contains the script

## 🎊 Future Updates

# helmetdetection
Helmet Detection With GUI in python tkinter.

I created Graphical user Interface in Phase 1.

Now in Phase 2:
I created a script to detect bike on video footage.
But that is not yet integrated in GUI part.

I am still making algorithm for helmet detection.

I will update the code and upload it as soon as the beta test is completed.

Thank You.
