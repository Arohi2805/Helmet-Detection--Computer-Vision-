## 🧑🏻‍🏫 Manifest

```
- bike.ipynb --> A python file that run's Helmet-Detection code
- bike.xml   --> A xml file which has the entries of all the co-ordinates of each 
                 image(in the image folder) and has been trained on detecting two classes 
                      1. Helmet
                      2. No Helmet
- README.md ---> This markdown file you are reading.
- Image ----> Image folder has all the images of people wearing and not wearing Helmet
- movie2.mp4 --> These is the movie file on which we are going to run our Helmet-Detection
                 model
                 (Anybody can change these movie file and put there's file for testing😀)
```


## 🤔 Prerequisites

- [Python](https://www.python.org/ "Python") Installed

- Python Basics Understanding

- [OpenCV](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/ "OpenCV") Library Installed 

- Computer Vision Basic Understanding

## 🛠️ Installation Steps

1. Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual "Anaconda") Software

2. Click on Juypter Notebook

3. Create a seperate folder of any name you want

4. Upload 3 files there bike.ipynb, movie2.mp4 and bike.xml in that folder

5. Run bike.ipynb

**🎇 You are Ready to Go!**

## ❗ Installation of Important Libraries

Before running the .ipynb file we need to import some of the libraries using terminal 

In the Anaconda Terminal, you can run:

```Bash
pip install opencv-python
```

For installing TKinter (If it shows the error that Tkinter is not installed)

```Bash
pip install python-tk
```

## Installation of labelImg

- LabelImg - LabelImg is a free, open source tool for graphically labeling images. It’s written in Python and uses QT for its graphical interface. It’s an easy, free way to label a few hundred images 
- Installation steps as in command prompt.


## 📂 Directory Structure

> [`create.bat`](https://github.com/king-technologies/Project-Initiator/blob/main/create.bat "Create Command"): Command file that will execute the python file

> [`remote.py`](https://github.com/king-technologies/Project-Initiator/blob/main/remote.py "Main File"): Python file, the main file that contains the script

## 🎊 Future Updates

- [ ] Add project boilerplate automatically for different languages and frameworks

- [ ] Add GUI

- [ ] Add Other VCS

# helmetdetection
Helmet Detection With GUI in python tkinter.

I created Graphical user Interface in Phase 1.

Now in Phase 2:
I created a script to detect bike on video footage.
But that is not yet integrated in GUI part.

I am still making algorithm for helmet detection.

I will update the code and upload it as soon as the beta test is completed.

Thank You.
